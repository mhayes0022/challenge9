# README Generator

## Page Description

This is a README generator. When you run the index.js file in the terminal in VS Code, the user will be prompted with a series of questions. The first is "What is the title of your project?" When the user types their response and hits enter, they will be prompted with the next question. The next question is "What is a brief description of your project?", then "What are your installation instructions for your project?", "What is the usage information for the 
project?", "What are the contribution guidelines for the project?", and "What are the testing instructions for the project?" Next, the user will be prompted to choose a license for their project. They are given a list of nine options, including the option to choose "none". The user is then asked "What is your GitHub username?" and lastly, "What is your email?" When the last question is anwered, the application will generate a README.md file and fill the appropriate sections with the data the user submitted. A badge is generated at the top of the file corresponding with the license they selected, and in the license section a link to that license is placed. If the user selected "none" for the license, the license section is omitted from the file.

## Credits

This application is composed partially of starter code provided by the University of Minnesota for their fullstack coding bootcamp program. I coded the generateMarkdown.js file, the 
licenseList.js file, and nearly all of the index.js file. The instructor provided help regarding where to find the licenses, and I received help from a tutor with how to generate the license badges.
